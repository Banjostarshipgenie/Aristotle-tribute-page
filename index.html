                <p>Aristotle, Greek Aristoteles, (born 384 bce, Stagira, Chalcidice, Greece—died 322, Chalcis, Euboea), ancient Greek     </p>
                <p>philosopher and scientist, one of the greatest intellectual figures of Western history. He was the author of a</p>
                <p>philosophical and scientific system that became the framework and vehicle for both Christian Scholasticism and medieval</p>
                <p>Islamic philosophy. Even after the intellectual revolutions of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment,</p>
                <p>Aristotelian concepts remained embedded in Western thinking.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s intellectual range was vast, covering most of the sciences and many of the arts, including biology, botany,</p>
                <p>chemistry, ethics, history, logic, metaphysics, rhetoric, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, physics, poetics,</p>
                <p>political theory, psychology, and zoology. He was the founder of formal logic, devising for it a finished system that</p>
                <p>for centuries was regarded as the sum of the discipline; and he pioneered the study of zoology, both observational and</p>
                <p>theoretical, in which some of his work remained unsurpassed until the 19th century. But he is, of course, most</p>
                <p>outstanding as a philosopher. His writings in ethics and political theory as well as in metaphysics and the philosophy</p>
                <p>of science continue to be studied, and his work remains a powerful current in contemporary philosophical debate.</p>
                <p>This article deals with Aristotle’s life and thought. For the later development of Aristotelian philosophy, see</p>
                <p>Aristotelianism. For treatment of Aristotelianism in the full context of Western philosophy, see philosophy, Western.</p>
